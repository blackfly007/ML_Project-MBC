# ML_Project-MBC
In this ML project, we were provided with a dataset of Breast Cancer and here we have to predict the MALIGNANCY OF BREAST CANCER by using different types of classification algorithms like decision tree, logistic regression, k-NN and SVM. We have applied this algorithms and made a comparative study of accuracies obtained from different classification algorithms applied on that dataset.
